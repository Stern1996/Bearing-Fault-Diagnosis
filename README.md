# Bearing-Fault-Diagnosis
03, Feb.

In this repository, some typical machine learning models are listed. These models are used for bearing fault diagnosis.

The modules of ML-models are stored in the corresponding folders. Since so far I have only done a preliminary study of the different ML-Models of this theme, there is no one main program that connects all modules together, so the modules have to be run in order.

You can see the running order in the corresponding folder.(Readme-File)
